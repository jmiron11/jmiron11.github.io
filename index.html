            <p class="about-me-info spacing"><b>Hi I'm Justin Miron. I am a junior at the Univeristy of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign I will be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in May of 2017. I am hoping this webpage gives people an idea of who I am and what I am passionate about! </b>
            <br><br>
            A little about my me, I spent most of my life hopping from country to country as I grew up. My childhood was spent in Saudia Arabia and Kuwait and my teenage years bouncing between Indonesia and China before ending up in the US. It has been a weird and wonderful ride, but I eventually ended up studying at UofI. Being raised on computers, I thought Computer Engineering would be a great fit. It definitely was. I love what I am learning and know this is what I always want to keep doing.
            <br><br>

            More recently, I was lucky enough to spend the summer in Carslbad, CA interning at ViaSat. It was a pretty amazing experience getting to travel across the country to work, see new sights, and work with plenty of new people. Additionally, I worked on side projects that I am pretty passionate about! A few of which are available to check out on the <a href="./projects/">projects</a> page as well as on my <a href="github.com/jmiron11">Github</a>.
            <br><br>
            There is also plenty about me outside of academics! I am an avid follower of hockey, specifically the (greatest) hockey team, the Detroit Red Wings. On top of that I love nature and exploring all that there is in the area, wherever I might be. For activities, I play badminton, rock climb, and I recently started playing volleyball over the summer. I love being active, but I also like being slightly unactive as well! I have been known to play copious amounts of video games when the mood is right, as well as binge rewatch my favorite TV shows.
