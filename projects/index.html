                <h3>HTML - AngularJS - NodeJS - Mopidy</h3>
                <p>
                A collaborative playlist queue with spotify integration created at the corporate Viasat 2015 Hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                The jukebox works based on a system of voting for tracks within a shared playlist. This is geared at music choice within group settings. The order of the next played queue is based off of the users' votes on songs.
                </p>
                <p>
                The app consisted of a front-end consisted of a web app built with HTML and AngularJS that interacted with the back-end node.JS server that handled interactions with the external Mopidy server.
                </p>
                <p>
                My contribution was the back-end Node.JS server. The server handled input from the clients through HTTP requests and used that information to interact with the music server as well as manage the song queue.

                <h2><b>Music Swap</b></h2>
                <h3>Java - NodeJS - mongoDB</h3>
                <p>
                A music artist sharing android app based around matching users with similar preferences. Users that had similar tastes are able to recommend artists to one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                The front-end of the app was built in Android Studio and allowed the user to set up a profile as well as send requests to the server to find matches based on the profile. The front-end used the LastFM API to request and store album and artist art to enhance the visuals of the app. A websocket wrapper for Java was also used to communicate with the Node.JS back-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Node.JS server's main purpose was to manage the mongoDB server. Through repeated queries, the node.JS server would two clients with an artist match and send a reply back to the clients as well as store the information to keep the two connected. Following a connection clients were able to send artist names to eachother to share music tastes.

                Thus far we planned features as well as well as designed the UI. We have come up with what is neccessary to get the app in a working state and have begun coding.

                The window manager currently supports handling keybindings for window managment, redirection of requests to the window manager, as well as handling those requests including mapping of windows.
